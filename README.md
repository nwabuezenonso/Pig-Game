This game is a simple example of the manipulation of the DOM using javascript, here are the rules of the game.

The game consist of two players and a dice.
On each of the players turn, the player is to roll the dice as multiply times as possible to get multiple scores and store in his current score box.
While rolling the dice, once a player hits number 1 on the dice, he loses all the scores he has gathered in his current score box.
To avoid losing all the scores in his current score box, a player can hold his current score which stores and adds it to his total score.
The first player to score more than 100 points is the winner!
Good luck with this game and try not to roll a number 1 dice, Lol.
